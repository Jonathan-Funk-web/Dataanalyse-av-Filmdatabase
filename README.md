# Data analasys of The Movie Database
In this project I will use TMDB's API to do some basic dataanalasys. My plan is to analyse:
- What directors has directed the most movies/tv-shows
- What actors have been the most active
- What genres has been most popular each decade
And also a few other things I find would be interesting to know about.  

I am going to have the data i use saved as .json files, and plan on making graphs with matplot.lib or something similar near the end to visualise the data.
