# Data analasys of The Movie Database
In this project I will use a Kaggle dataset to do some basic dataanalasys. My plan is to analyse:
- What directors has directed the most movies/tv-shows
- What actors have been the most active
- What genres has been most popular each decade
And also a few other things I find would be interesting to know about.  

This is also my first proper project, so there will most likely be a few mistakes, both when it comes to coding and coding practices.
