# Data analasys of The Movie Database
In this project I will use a Kaggle dataset to do some basic dataanalasys. My plan is to analyse:
- What directors has directed the most movies/tv-shows
- What actors have been the most active
- What genres has been most popular each decade
And also a few other things I find would be interesting to know about.  

This is also my first proper project, so there will most likely be a few mistakes, both when it comes to coding and coding practices.

 The program uses data from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanvourch/tmdb-movies-daily-updates).


Since this was one of my first big coding projects, there are some code here that I can definitly make better. Such as the 3 layers deep `for` loops, i do need to refactor this code at one point.
