    "I was at first going to just use [TMDB's API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), but I encountered a problem. When I was trying to call for the 501th page (i.e. pages 500+) it gave me a error with the text `Invalid page: Pages start at 1 and max at 500. They are expected to be an integer.`, this is quite annoying since the amount of pages as today (16 01 2025) is a whoping `48184`. And with the page limit I would only be able to access **just a bit over 1%** using this method. I did then discover the [daily ID](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/daily-id-exports) lists that they have. This was pretty sweet, but sadly i stumbled upon a me problem this time, my code was not good enough and I did not know how to improve it further, a aproximatly 190 hours of processing time to find directors from just the `People` list? Not acceptable, I then went for something a bit easier, I found this lovely [.csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanvourch/tmdb-movies-daily-updates) that user Alan Vourc'h had uploaded to Kaggle, and that file is what I am goign to use for this project."

    "3. Similar as to 1., but this time the `popularity` collumn will play in, if the movie in method 1. has a `popularity` score of `10` the decade `1980` will have `10 drama movie` \"points\" and `10 comedy movie` \"points\".\n",
